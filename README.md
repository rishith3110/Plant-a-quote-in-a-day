Plant a Quote in a Day  (Live webiste : )
"Even the dark room has a light where it comes from a presence of a human or a living thing!"

About the Project
This is my very first solo project, a simple yet functional website designed to brighten a user's day with a meaningful quote and a matching music recommendation based on their mood. It's a fun and engaging way to connect with users on an emotional level through dynamic content.

I built this project to practice my core web development skills from scratch, focusing on the fundamentals of front-end development.

Features
Mood-Based Content: The website dynamically generates a new quote and song link after the user selects their mood.

Dynamic UI: Clicking the "Refresh" button provides a new quote and song without needing to change the mood selection.

Aesthetic Design: The clean, dark theme and professional UI offer a modern and pleasant user experience.

Responsive Layout: The design adapts to different screen sizes, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic structure and content of the webpage.

CSS: For all the styling, including the dark theme, layout, and animations. I used CSS variables to make the color palette easily customizable.

JavaScript: To handle all the logic, from the mood selection to the dynamic display of quotes and music links.
